# ANN-based-power-and-current-limiting-strategy-for-DG-systems
In this project an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) based internal controller is used for limiting power and current flow from a distributed generation system connected to the grid. There are 6 different case studies given here. Case 1 and 2 demonstrates how the DG system respondes to grid frequency change without and with modified droop control strategy respectively. Case 3 and 4 demonstrates how the DG system respondes to grid voltage magnitude change without and with modified droop control strategy respectively. Case 5 demonstrates how modified droop control mechanisms works when there is simultaneous change in grid frequency and voltage magnitude. Along with that a balanced load is injected. Case 6 demonstrates how modified droop control mechanisms works when there is simultaneous change in grid frequency and voltage magnitude. Along with that an unbalanced load is injected. All the case studies are demonstrated in matlab simulink environment.
